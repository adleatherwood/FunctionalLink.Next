<h2 id="coming-from-functionallink">Coming from FunctionalLink</h2>
<p>This library is a reincarnation of a previous library <a href="https://gitlab.com/adleatherwood/FunctionalLink">FunctionalLink</a>.  I
have written a significant amount of code with that library but felt that some of the choices I had made were limiting.  There
were several issues I had with the library:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was some overreaching functionality that was never really used.</li>
<li>Some naming that was hard for people to understand (e.g. Bind).</li>
<li>Some fancy asynchronous work (that was nice) but misplaced.</li>
<li>A dozen ad-hoc extension methods that were not focused enough to fit the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>The library's purpose was to bring a few functional programming concepts to C# in an idiomatic way.  At the time, I thought
the choices I had made were idiomatic.  But after using it for awhile, I've found that things can be simplified.  That's
what this library is.  A reduction of the first.  Down to it's most important parts.</p>
<h2 id="language-used">Language Used</h2>
<p>While the language of the original library is more concise and accurate, the new library aims to use language that is more
familiar and intuitive.  Originally, there were 3 main compositional functions: Bind, Map, &amp; Void.  Used hypothetically like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">Result.Success(value)
    .Bind(Validate) // i.e. SelectMany or FlatMap in other languages
    .Map(ToString)  // i.e. Select in Linq
    .Void(Console.WriteLine)
</code></pre>
<p>While the distinctions between those functions are interesting to note, they only served to be distracting to read for most
people.  All anyone really wants to know is what's happening, and what's next.  While functional languages don't generally have
function overloads, C# does.  So I've adopted the languages of Promises and bundled those functions under &quot;Then&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">Result.Success(value)
    .Then(Validate)
    .Then(ToString)
    .Then(Console.WriteLine)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="bare-minimum">Bare Minimum</h2>
<p>There are actually only two main types in this library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option<t></t></li>
<li>Result&lt;T,TFailure&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else that exists is purely to support those two types and make the use of them more intuitive and seamless.  In general,
you should not be aware that any other types are being used.</p>
<h2 id="declaration--workflow-over-inference--exceptions">Declaration &amp; Workflow over Inference &amp; Exceptions</h2>
<p>Developer optimism is a very common problem.  Take this function signature below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">static User FindUser(string userId) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>At face value, it would appear that this function will always return a User.  Except, as experienced developers, we know that can't
be true.  So we <strong>infer</strong> that FindUser must return null when it can't find the requested entity.  Maybe we'll even dig through it's
implementation to find out if we are correct.  A more declarative (and informative) way to write this
signature could be like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">static Option&lt;User&gt; FindUser(string userId) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we're being told quite explicitly that a result may not be found.  And we are given a return type that allows us to write &quot;Happy Path&quot;
code when consuming that type:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">FindUser(&quot;123&quot;)
    .Then(user =&gt; $&quot;{user.FirstName} {user.LastName}&quot;)
    .Then(name =&gt; Console.WriteLine(name))
</code></pre>
<p>But this call also <strong>implies</strong> I/O.  Which is typically an behavior that throws exceptions.  So far, we know we might not get a user
back from our call.  But the signature doesn't express anything about something going wrong.  And since it has the potential for an
exception, we now have to decide if we should try/catch this call or let the exception fly.  Let's avoid all of that ambiguity and
adjust the signature to tell the consumer something can go wrong without an exception being thrown.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">static Result&lt;User, Exception&gt; FindUser(string userId) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now the caller can choose what to do with the Exception rather than just throwing it up the chain and hoping it's caught and handled
in some way.  This is really the goal of this library.  To encourage developers to be explicit and code for all possibilities in any
given context.  The benefits of functional composition run deeper than this, but this kind of thinking is the entry point for what's
possible.</p>
